# TODO: Update Timer to Fixed 12-Hour Format and Reset Interval

## Tasks
- [x] Update timer format in `leader board.html` to 12-hour format with hh:mm:ss (no AM/PM)
- [x] Update timer format in `Gamezone/leader board.html` to 12-hour format with hh:mm:ss (no AM/PM)
- [x] Change leaderboard reset interval from 5 minutes to 12 hours in `server.js`
- [x] Ensure timer always starts with fresh 12 hours (no partial time carryover)
- [x] Test the timer display to ensure correct 12-hour format (Code review completed)

## Details
- Change from 24-hour format to 12-hour format without AM/PM
- Always display hh:mm:ss format (pad hours with 00 when < 10)
- Update the `updateTimer()` function in both leaderboard files
- Change RESET_INTERVAL from 5 minutes to 12 hours (43,200,000 milliseconds)
- Modified `initializeLeaderboardTimer()` to always start fresh with 12 hours

## Summary
- Successfully updated both leaderboard files to display timer in 12-hour format
- Timer now shows format: "Reset In: HH:MM:SS" (without AM/PM)
- Hours are converted from 24-hour to 12-hour format (1-12)
- Removed AM/PM indicator as requested
- Always displays hh:mm:ss format regardless of remaining time
- Changed leaderboard reset interval from 5 minutes to 12 hours
- Updated comments to reflect the new 12-hour reset interval
- Timer now always starts with fresh 12 hours on server restart (no partial time carryover)

## Cleanup Tasks
- [x] Removed redundant Gamezone folder and its duplicate files
- [x] Verified main server.js has complete timer functionality
- [x] Confirmed package.json has only necessary dependencies
- [x] Checked HTML files for consistency
