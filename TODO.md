# Leaderboard Timer Synchronization Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated server.js to add global leaderboard timer logic
- [x] Added /api/leaderboard-timer endpoint to get current reset time
- [x] Updated leader board.html to use global timer instead of localStorage
- [x] Updated QA.html to use global timer instead of localStorage
- [x] Added auto-reset functionality every 10 minutes on server
- [x] Fixed timer reset issue when switching tabs or refreshing page
- [x] Improved visibility change handler to re-sync timer when tab becomes visible

## Pending Tasks
- [x] Test timer synchronization across multiple browser tabs/users
- [x] Verify timer resets work correctly for all users
- [x] Test server restart behavior (timer should initialize properly)
- [x] Verify API_BASE URL configuration is correct for deployment

## Implementation Details
- Server maintains global `leaderboardEndTime` variable that all users share
- Timer resets every 10 minutes (600,000 ms) automatically on server
- Frontend fetches global time from `/api/leaderboard-timer` endpoint
- Fallback to local timer if API fails
- When timer expires, it fetches updated time instead of resetting locally
- Tab visibility changes now properly re-sync the timer
- All users see the same countdown timer regardless of when they load the page

## Key Fixes Applied
- Fixed timer starting from beginning when switching tabs or refreshing
- Improved expired timer handling to fetch updated server time
- Enhanced visibility change handler to maintain synchronization
- Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
